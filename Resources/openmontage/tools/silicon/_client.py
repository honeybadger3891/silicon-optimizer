"""The one HTTP client the three Silicon tools share.

The app publishes where it is listening in a handshake file — port, pid, and a
per-launch bearer token — and this reads it the same way the app's own MCP bridge
does. No configuration: if the app is running, the tools work.

Two overrides exist for the case where the app is on *another* Mac on your
network (its control server can bind beyond loopback with the swarm token set):

    SILICON_OPTIMIZER_URL=http://<that-mac>:8791
    SILICON_OPTIMIZER_TOKEN=<its swarm token>

With those set the handshake file is not consulted at all.
