#
# Builds Silicon Optimizer.app from the SwiftPM executable.
#
# SwiftPM produces a bare Mach-O binary; macOS needs a bundle directory around it before
# LSUIElement, the app icon, or a code signature mean anything. This assembles that bundle.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/build-app.sh [--release] [--sign "Developer ID Application: ..."] [--dmg]
#                        [--install [DIR]]
#
# --install puts the finished bundle somewhere stable — ~/Applications by default — replacing
# whatever was there. Without it the only copy lives in build/, which is gitignored and easy to
# clean away, so anything pointing at it (a login item, the Dock, a second copy someone dragged
# to /Applications months ago) drifts out of date silently. Installing every build to one place
# is what keeps "the app" and "the build" the same thing.
